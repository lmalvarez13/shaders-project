# WebGL Shaders Project

Made as a final assignment for Computer Graphics subject at the University.

## What I learned throughout this course

- Theorical understanding of how:
  - Blending formulas are applied to 3D objects (parametrics surfaces/BÃ©zier patches/NURBS surfaces) 
  - Catmull-Clark Subdivision: how it works & application
  - Meshes 3D represantation: how .obj loads in GPU memory, meshes tophologies, Halfedge structure
  - Texture mappings, GPU Pipeline (Vertex->Razterization->Fragment), Mipmaps, Bilinear/Trilinear & Anisotropic filtering
  - Lighting effects calculation: diffuse lighting, specular reflexion, Phong/Blinn-Phong models, Phong/Gouraud shadows
 
- Practical application of:
  - GPU Pipeline with GLSL: from how .obj files are loaded to the application of vertex/fragment shaders
  - Camera's 3D space represantation: Orthographic vs Perspective projection
  - Phong's lighting effect: application & variants
  - Implemented different Fragment shaders from scratch on GLSL (Toon/Cosine/Stripe/Dot/Pencil shaders)
